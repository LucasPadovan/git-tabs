Right now, git-tabs isn't able to work properly because the way buffers are serialized in Atom. There has been some activity around this recently so it might change in the future, but for now git-tabs is not going to be maintained.

# git-tabs package

Git Tabs remembers what tabs you had open for each git branch and will open them up for you.
